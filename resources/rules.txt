rooms may yield more
than you expect
experimentation is key

some doors
require a blessing
carry them with you

the walls will harden
over time
time is the essence

sleeping gatekeepers
will need to be awoken
with a loud sound

a piece of paper
is your guide

deny his gifts
to attain your reward

a dark market
lies under your feet

chub dislikes smoke!

step on the
black bubbles

a golden being might
show himself

it's too dark to
see the portrait
of the sun

with destruction of the
mother orb comes change

wait for the corn to
grow for its power
to emerge

blacksmiths enjoy
mineshafts
pay them a visit

give the robot
some smoke
if you want his card

the malicious beggar
also hates smoke

dig the dark floor
with magical runes

enough tinkering
and he'll give you
his tools

a fiendish prankster
can help you
or hinder you

the mist
announces
her arrival

check behind
the pillars

you are behind
strange doors

rules never lie

lend a coin to the
fortune machine

the little one
rewards pacifism

between the walls
persists a master
of the elements
